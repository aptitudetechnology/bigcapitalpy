## Conclusion

BigCapitalPy has established a solid foundation with core accounting functionality successfully implemented. However, approximately 60-70% of the original BigCapital's advanced features remain unimplemented. The priority should be on completing core business modules (invoicing, bills, payments) before moving to advanced features.

The current architecture provides a good foundation for implementing the missing functionality, but significant development effort will be required to achieve feature parity with the original BigCapital system.
